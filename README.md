# Database project for the mentorship program

Aim is to make progress on building a fast (ish) time-series database from scratch, in C++.

# Participants

- Joe Murdoch
- Perry Hui

You need to have [bazel](https://bazel.build/install) installed to build the project.

Then, to check everything is in order:

```
